Is built on top of golang crypto package and at the time of this writing is focused on file encryption. This article&amp;rsquo;s goal is to test its performance on &amp;ldquo;big&amp;rdquo; files, its concurrency and its multi architecture and multi platform support as well as explaining the software design decisions.</description></item></channel></rss>
